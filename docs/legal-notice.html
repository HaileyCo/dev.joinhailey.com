          <p >
          The Website collects and process Personal Data for the following purposes:
          <ul class="list-inside ">
            <li>Allowing a correct use of the Website, essentially through the
              use of Cookies (see below point 8).</li>
            <li>Offering the requested Services to the Users. </br>
              Processing of Personal Data for the purpose indicated under
              lit. b) is necessary for the fulfilment of the requested Services
              and it is based on the free, specific, informed and unequivocal
              consent of the User. The potential refusal of the User to provide
              the consent for the processing will impede the fulfilment of the
              requested Services;</li>
            <li>Allowing the possibility to receive information via email
              and/or invitations to initiatives organized by Hailey, on an
              occasional basis. <br>
              This Processing is based on the free consent of
            the User and it isn’t necessary for the fulfilment of the Services.
            The potential refusal of the User to provide the consent will only
          impede the User to receive information and/or the invitations to
          initiatives organized by Hailey.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-10">4. Means of Collection</h3>
          <p >
          Hailey collects the Personal Data through the following means of collections:
          <ul class="list-inside ">
            <li>Personal data automatically collected by the Website through
              the Cookies (see below point 8);</li>
            <li>Personal Data provided by the Users, by filling in the forms on
              the Website to request the Services;</li>
            <li>Personal Data expressly provided by the Users to Hailey through
              offline means, such as via e-mail or mail or phone calls.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-10">5. Categories of Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
          <p >
          Personal Data may be disclosed and communicated for the purposes
          indicated in the aforementioned article 3 to: Members of the Board,
          internal Collaborators, IT services providers. Personal Data is not
          communicated outside of the European Union.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-10">6. Personal Data Retention Period</h3>
          <p >
          Personal Data is stored by the Data Controller for the time strictly
          necessary to achieve the purposes for which the Personal Data are
          collected, as indicated in the aforementioned article 3.  In
          particular, the Data Controller stores the Personal Data for the
          entire time necessary to fulfil the activities connected with the
          requested Services, save for the right to withdraw the consent as
          indicated in the following article 7 lit. a), for a maximum period of
          24 months since the collection of consent or, if subsequent, the date
          of the last interaction between the User and Hailey (for instance the
          exchange of correspondence or the attendance to initiatives organized
          by Hailey).
          </p>
          <p>
          In any case, the Data Controller is authorized to retain all or part of the
          Personal Data in relation to the aforementioned Processing, for the maximum
          period of 10 years since the last activity performed in favour of the User to
          fulfil the Services, only to the extent of the information required to fulfil
          legal or fiscal obligations and for the possible assessment, exercise and
          defence of its rights before judicial authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
          Once these retention periods have expired, the Data Controller will
          carry out the automatic erasure of Personal Data collected; otherwise
          it will transform them into anonymous form irreversibly.
          </p>
